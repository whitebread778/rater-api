# rater_api #
Rater is a BCIT COMP 4514 school term project done by Johnny, Justin, Mai and Kailin over 4 months. 
We use C# for backend, React for frontend and SQlite for database. 
## Rater Backend: ##
Rater is a review website where students can view and post a BCIT program review.
This is the backend repo. To have the full app running, you will also need to download frontend react app from this repo title [link](https://github.com/whitebread778/rater-frontend)


## Why We Build Rater? ##
There are other review websites/platforms where students share their experiences with post-secondary schools or programs. However, we couldn't find one specifically for BCIT student, and we wanted to build a safe space for any BCIT students to share their experience with BCIT's program anonymously. We believe that these honest reviews will help future students make critical education choices.
